# Rain-Alert-Using-Python

In this project I have developed a Rain Alert System for the weather where I stay using Python and API's. So the flow of the code is as follows

**Requirements**
1. You will be needing API key from OpenWeather Map to retrieve weather data
2. And also an API key from Twilio to send SMS for alerts

Just login and you will get your API keys

1. Retrieving waether data from OpenWeatherMap using Longitude and Latitude of your location
2. Filtering data you want. For eg: Location, time, Weather etc..
3. Sending SMS using Twilio API to registered mobile number

And that's all!!  You have created your own weather alert system
